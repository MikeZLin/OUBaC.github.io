Congratulations to the Oxford team who pulled out an excellent overall victory over Cambridge last weekend. The team scores were as follows:
</p>
<p style="margin-left:15px;">
	Mens 1st Team - 9 - 6
<br />
	Womens 1st Team - 12 - 3
<br />
	Mens 2nd Team - 5 - 10
<br />
	Womens 2nd Team - 12 - 3
<br />
	Mens 3rd Team - 8 - 7
<br />
<br />
	Overall 46 - 29
</p>
<p>
In particular well done to the two womens teams for getting a clean-sweep against the Cambridge ladies and the Mens 3rd team for holding their nerve to edge out a very close win. Consider the tabs shoed for another year!
