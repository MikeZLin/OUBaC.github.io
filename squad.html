<h2>Squad</h2>
<p>
The Squad is the competitive aspect of Oxford University Badminton Club. The squad selects players from the University Trials in Michaelmas Term. Whilst the trials tend to be dominated by incoming Freshers, O.U.Ba.C. encourages people from all years to try out.
</p>
<p>
The squad competes in the BUCS league, and enters pairings into the BUCS individual tournament in November. If you are selected to represent O.U.Ba.C. in the BUCS individual tournaments, and succesfully reach the quarter-finals or further, you will be awarded a full Blue. Players who represent the O.U.Ba.C. 1st team in the annual Varsity match gain a half-Blue.
