<h2>Squad</h2>
<p>
The Squad is the competitive aspect of Oxford University Badminton Club. The squad selects players from the University Trials in Michaelmas Term (The details of our squad trials this year can be found here). Whilst the trials tend to be dominated by incoming Freshers, O.U.Ba.C. encourages people from all years to try out.
</p>
<p>
The squad competes in the BUCS league, and enters pairings into the BUCS individual tournament in November. If you are selected to represent O.U.Ba.C. in the BUCS individual tournaments, and succesfully reach the quarter-finals or further, you will be awarded a full Blue. Players who represent the O.U.Ba.C. 1st team in the annual Varsity match gain a half-Blue.

<h2>Varsity</h2>
<p>
Every year all five squads of the Oxford University Badminton Club face off against their old rivals from Cambridge University in the Varsity match. Oxford has been in the ascendancy in recent years. The final score in the 2014 match was a comfortable 46-29 win.
