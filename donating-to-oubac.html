<h2>Donating to OUBaC</h2>
<p>
	Despite our recent successes OUBaC is showing no sign of slowing down and we have big plans for the future including additional coaching from top national coaches, expansion of training time available for squad players, greater funding and support for blues players to travel to national tournaments and an annual tour to compete against other Universities around the world. Unfortunately the cost of running the club has risen sharply in recent years due mainly to a rise in the cost of feather shuttles. Although we are exploring all possibilities to cut costs and raise additional funds the club has come under considerable financial pressure.
</p>
<p>
	OUBaC needs substantial financial support if we are to continue to expand and so we are extremely grateful for any donations. If you would like to donate then please send an email to our president {[site.data.variables.President.name]} at <a href="mailto:{[site.data.variables.President.email]}">{[site.data.variables.President.email]}</a>
</p>
<p>
	Donations will be used to finance the following: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Coaching for squad players</li>
	<li>Purchasing more court time</li>
	<li>Transport to matches and tournaments</li>
	<li>Affiliation costs</li>
	<li>Shuttles and other equipment</li>
	<li>Team kits</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Thank you!
