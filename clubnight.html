<h2>Clubnight</h2>
<p>
	Clubnight is a time for all members of the Club to get together and play badminton. The friendly environment makes Clubnight lots of fun and a good place to make friends outside college. As the Club is so big there is always a good turnout which means plenty of competitive games for players of all standards. To ensure that everyone gets to meet everyone else and get an equal number of games a peg-board system is operated in most sessions.
</p>
<p>
	The badminton club is fantastic value at only &pound;30 for the whole year. Membership entitles you to well over 350 hours of badminton in the year with shuttles provided and a limited number of rackets available for those who do not have their own. (Guests are welcome at any Clubnight, but a &pound;3 fee per session is charged for non-members.) There are also several heavily subsidised social events throughout the year, in particular, the Annual Black-tie Dinner which is a chance to get dressed up for an excellent night out. To find out how to join, see our booth at the Freshers' fair in Michaelmas term, or contact the clubnight representative.

<h2>Clubnight Tournament</h2>
<p>
	In previous years a relaxed Clubnight tournament was run at the end of each term. However due to the popularity of Clubnight sessions this tradition has fallen by the wayside of late but the new Clubnight representatives may bring it back this year.  It is a social tournament and emphasis is on the participation. There is usually a small prize, often of the edible variety, for the winners, and for a pair who we feel has 'over achieved'!. 
</p>
<p>
	Pairs can enter as mens, womens or mixed teams. Pairings are usually arranged on the night. 
	There are round robin group stages guaranteeing each pair at least 3 games. Each group is seeded to avoid 'groups of death', though of course the best pair will always win! 
</p>
<p>
	Good Luck!
